      <div><strong>User1:</strong> Hello!IoT stands for Internet of Things, which is a network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity to exchange data over the internet. These devices can range from everyday objects like smart thermostats, wearables, or even industrial machinery. IoT enables these devices to collect and share data, and often interact with each other or perform intelligent actions based on the data received. Now coming to your question, if it is related to IoT, I will gladly answer it. If it is not related to IoT, I will inform you that it is an out-of-scope question. Please go ahead and ask your question, and I'll let you know.</div>
